<h1>Welcome</h1>
<p>This is my Website where I will put all my Minecraft Server Links, You can play all of these in the browser.</p>
  
<p> Remember to Turn down the Render distance to short or tiny for more performance, Turning off fog and antialiasing also helps.</p>
  <p> Also turn Performance to max fps for more fps </p>
